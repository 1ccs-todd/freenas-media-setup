***Setup Structure***
```
__POOL__ > __MEDIA_DATASET__ >  -series
                 -movies
                 -downloads > -radarr
                              -sonarr
                              -complete
                              -incomplete
                              -recycle bin   
                            ```

You have pool named "__POOL__". And created a dataset named "__MEDIA_DATASET__" owned by the default freenas user __MEDIA_USER__:__MEDIA_GROUP__. The dataset contains the folders: series,movies, and downloads. You also have a dataset named "__APPS_DATASET__" to hold the config data.

```
***ISSUES RESOLVED IN INSTALL SCRIPTS:***
```
Permissions
------  
For Sonarr, Radarr, Lidarr, and Transmission you will have to change the default user to __MEDIA_USER__:__MEDIA_GROUP__ so the jails can work together properly.
MONO 5.20 compatibility
------
Sonarr and Lidarr have moved away from mono 5.10.  For these two, PORTS are installed to apply a patch to v5.20.1.34 and installed. 
OPENVPN
------
A VPN may not be desired by everyone. Execute "transmission_add_VPN.sh" to process the necessary additions for __TRANSMISSION_JAIL__.
