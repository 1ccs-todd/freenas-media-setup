***Setup Structure***
```
__POOL__ > __MEDIA_DATASET__ >  -series
                 -movies
                 -downloads > -radarr
                              -sonarr
                              -complete
                              -incomplete
                              -recycle bin   
                            ```

I have pool named __POOL__. I created a dataset named "__MEDIA_DATASET__" owned by the default freenas user __MEDIA_USER__:__MEDIA_GROUP__. The dataset contains the folders series,movies,downloads. Radarr, Sonarr, Transmission will need to run as the user __MEDIA_USER__:__MEDIA_GROUP__ to have access to them, this is very important and should not be overlooked. I also have a dataset named "__APPS_DATASET__" to hold the config data.
```

**Permissions**
------  
```
For Sonarr, Radarr, Transmission you will have to change the default user to __MEDIA_USER__:__MEDIA_GROUP__ so the jails can work together properly.

Use the name of your plugin instead of PLUGIN

service PLUGIN onestop
chown -R __MEDIA_USER__:__MEDIA_GROUP__ /usr/local/PLUGIN (this location might be different for some of the apps)
sysrc 'PLUGIN_user=__MEDIA_USER__'
sysrc 'PLUGIN_group=__MEDIA_GROUP__'
service PLUGIN start
```

On Windows, you need to change the End of Line (EOL) format in Notepad++ to UNIX:

use ee editor or it won't work at least for me!
Create an rc file for radarr using your favorite editor at /mnt/iocage/jails/radarr/root/usr/local/etc/rc.d/radarr

iocage exec radarr mkdir /usr/local/etc/rc.d
iocage exec radarr "ee /mnt/iocage/jails/radarr/root/usr/local/etc/rc.d/radarr"
